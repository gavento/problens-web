# What This Mini-Course Covers <a id="what-this-course-covers"></a>

We take a problem-driven approach in this mini-course. We begin with real-world puzzles and challenges [at the beginning of it](00-introduction), and use them to understand KL divergence and the related theory.

Throughout the mini-course, we will explore concepts like KL divergence, entropy, cross-entropy, maximum likelihood and maximum entropy principles, machine-learning loss functions, mutual information, and more. The applications of this are in the areas of probability, statistics, machine learning, information and coding theory, financial math, and more.

By the end of this course, you should understand not just how KL divergence and related techniques works but, hopefully, you should have a better language and intuitions for all kinds of problems that involve reasoning under uncertainty.

# About This Project

🔭 We (Tom and Vašek) met in 2025 and realized they are both excited by some aspects of probability theory related to how we can use it as lenses to understand the world around us. We are both fans of LessWrong-style rationality, but we are also academics, so we naturally wondered whether one can convey some of the rationalist insights and ways of looking at world in an academic course.

🧪 We decided to have a small experimental lecture at Charles university, and see what happens.

📐 Once we started teaching, we soon realized why university lectures look the way they do. 😅 It is hard to convey vibes, and it's good if the students have some kind of idea what you talk about, talked about, and plan to talk about. So, we postponed the ambitious and vague plan to later lectures and started to talk about a specific topic -- KL divergence. We kept postponing long enough to cover the topics you can find in this minicourse-webpage.

🚀 While KL divergence is a very specific topic, we feel that it's a pretty important part of the vague and ambitious goal we care about. It's closely related to all kinds of real-world applications of probability -- check out [Introduction](/00-introduction) to see for yourself!
